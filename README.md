## GRADING TODO
- [ ] Functional Requirements 35
  - [x] Map creation and editing 7
    - [x] User - driven creation of map elements, such as country, continent, and connectivity between countries. 1
    - [x] Saving a map to a file exactly as edited 1
    - [x] Loading a map from an existing file, then editing the map 1
    - [x] Use of the Adapter pattern to save / load from two different map file formats(see individual assignment 3). 2
    - [x] Verification of map correctness upon saving / loading(at least 3 types of incorrect maps, including verification that the
          map is a connected graph, and that each continent is a connected graph) 2
  - [ ] Game driver 4
    - [x] Implementation of a round - robin loop for players’ turns / phases, 
    - [x] identification of a winner and end of game, *DONE* See comment above on GameDriver::checkWinCondition()
    - [x] defeated player is removed from the round - robin loop. 2
    - [ ] Save / Load a game in progress using a Builder pattern(see individual assignment 3). 2
  - [ ] Game display 8 -- TOMORROW -- 
    - [ ] Player Observer that displays relevant information about a player(see individual assignment 2). 2
    - [ ] Map Observer that displays relevant information about the map(see individual assignment 2). 2
    - [ ] Game statistics Observer / Decorator that displays user - selected game statistics(see individual assignment 3). 2
		--CHRIS has this done but it is buggy and crap, it Update() doesn't work for more than two decorators
    - [ ] Game log Observer / Decorator that displays logging of user - selected players / phases(see individual assignment 3). 2
  - [ ] Startup phase 5
    - [ ] Game log and game statistics Observers are initially set to show user - selected parts(see individual assignment 3) 
          --Reza A3 has it done... needs to implement.
    - [ ] using the Observer and Decorator patterns. 1 --- See Previous Line
    - [ ] User selection of a previously user - saved map, then load the map. 1
    - [x] User chooses the number of players, all countries are randomly assigned. 1
    - [ ] Types of players are initially assigned and implemented using a Strategy pattern(see individual assignment 2).
          Types of players can be changed at any time during play. 2
  - [x] Reinforcement phase 4
    - [x] Calculation of correct number of reinforcement armies and placement of armies on the map. 1 @CHRIS TEST
    - [ x Correct implementation of cards and their additional reinforcements. 3 @CHRIS TEST 
  - [ ] Attack phase 6
    - [x] Correct identification of valid attacking / attacked country. 1
    - [ ] Correct implementation of an attack using the Risk battle model. 3 @Kendy Semi done... check and test...
    - [x] Correct implementation of the post - battle movement after a victory. 1
    - [ ] A victory gives a card, eliminating a player transfers all the defeated player’s cards. 1 @CHRIS test
  - [x] Fortification phase 1
    - [x] Implementation of a single valid move according to the Risk rules. 1 @CHRIS do we do more than one move ? @EVERYONE no we do not
